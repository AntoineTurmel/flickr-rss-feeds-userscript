# flickr-rss-feeds-userscript
Adds back RSS feeds to Flickr galleries

Since Flickr moved to the new design in May 2015, they decided to remove RSS feeds links in head tags.
Fortunately they still exists, and this userscript add them back automatically based on the user NSID (Flickr ID).

This userscript should work in Firefox, not yet tested on other browsers.
Feel free to open an issue if it's not working for you.

You can install it from Greasy Fork:
